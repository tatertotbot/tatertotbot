## Welcome to my GitHub Profile

I'm a computer science student. Apparently companies see my degree as something needed in order to apply for their jobs. Ironically, a majority of things I learn that are relevant to such jobs, are through my own side projects. Sometimes, I will post them here on my GitHub profile.
